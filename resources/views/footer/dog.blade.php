                and what you’re looking for in a companion. Here are some tips:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                <li><span class="font-bold">Activity Level:</span> Match the dog’s energy level with your own. Active
                    people might enjoy a high-energy breed, while less active individuals may prefer a more relaxed dog.
                </li>
                <li><span class="font-bold">Space:</span> Consider the size of your living space. Larger dogs may need
                    more room to roam.</li>
                <li><span class="font-bold">Family:</span> Make sure the dog’s temperament is suitable for your
                    household, especially if you have children or other pets.</li>
                <li><span class="font-bold">Time Commitment:</span> Ensure you have the time to devote to training,
                    exercise, and care.</li>
